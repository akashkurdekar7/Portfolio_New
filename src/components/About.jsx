            Hi, I'm a Frontend Developer who weaves code just like Spidey swings his web.
          </p>
          <p className=" size18 mb-3 text-justify">
            Iâ€™m driven by a love for clean, intuitive design and a passion for
            bringing ideas to life on the web. Think of me as a digital
            Spider-Manâ€”navigating through lines of code, scaling challenges with
            creativity, and landing smooth, sleek web experiences with flair.
          </p>
          <p className="size18 mb-3 text-justify">
            Whether it's building interactive animations or designing responsive
            layouts, I approach each project with the precision and excitement
            of a superheroâ€™s city swing.
          </p>
          <p className="size18">
            Letâ€™s create something truly amazing, one web at a time. ðŸš€
